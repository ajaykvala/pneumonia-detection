              This web application is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to recognise malaria parasite from human blood sample and nd pneumonia parasite from the chest x-ray. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 97% on the relevant test set of more than 1378 blood sample images for malaria and 93.6% on the test set of 624 chest x-ray images. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. In our case we have taken the dataset from the  from the official National Library of Medicine Website and  Mendeley Data

                <h4>Malaria</h4>
                <p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever. This is the most common symptom.</li>
                    <li>Chills</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pneumonia</h4>
                <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cough, which may produce greenish, yellow or even bloody mucus.</li>
                    <li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills.</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
                    <li>Rapid, shallow breathing.</li>
